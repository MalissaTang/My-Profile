          <h1>Malis Tang<br>StudentID:S3915292<br>Email:S3915292@student.rmit.edu.au</h1>
  <p>I was born in Cambodia, Phnom Penh, moved to Australia when I was about five months old to Noble Park, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It's honestly so strange
  <br>how my parents said they only came here with $50 in their pockets, so they came here to have a better life. We lived in a small cramped unit down in Noble Park, 
  <br>and then we moved to Tatura when I was about ten because dad had his job out here. I completed VCE and graduated in 2019, which was not long ago, and I didn't know 
  <br>if I wanted to take a gap year or not. 
  <br>So I tried to find what I wanted to do, did some real estate course, don't even know why I did a medical reception course and all these other things that cost me a 
  <br>lot of money.I didn't like any of them, and it bored me quickly, or I'd give up on it. So when I stopped doing my work for the courses, I tried many different jobs like sales,
  <br>working on a farm, packing tomatoes but now ended up being a sushi roll maker, Barista and now learning how to bake like PIES for my other bakery job? 
  <br>I've never done any IT Jobs and new to a lot of IT aspects. While working, I decided to be interested in IT because when I wasn't working or doing any course, 
  <br>I was gaming till 6 am, so I figured why not?
  <br>I was involved in many sports, played soccer for the Shepparton Club, did some fitness Bootcamp, played basketball, football, and volleyball competition. 
  <br>I'm still currently living at home with my parent's so, unfortunately, can't have a cat or a dog, so I bought three adorable Guinea Pigs named Dabao, Bean 
  <br>and Boo (Boo because he always runs away from me).

              <span class="square"></span>
              <p>I love technology and the way things work. Studying IT isn't just theoretical, but I also get hands-on experience.  Technology is continually growing, and working
              <br> with creative and challenging things is thrilling, and I find computers very cool. I also own a PC of my own, and it's fascinating how every component works, 
              <br>same with every gaming devices I have had; I want to see what goes on inside and how things work.
              <br>IT is the future. 
              <br>I am around technology every day, whether at work or when I am at home; when I get home, the first thing I do is hop on My PC, where all my friends are. 
              <br>My hobbies include computer time and gaming; working around my PC motivates me to further my study. Getting A PC first thing I wanted to do was build one on my own 
              <br>and have a deep knowledge of every component. Seeing my brother work in IT also pushes me to strive better and work on more challenging things. Imagining all the possibilities 
              <br>and outcomes of what is possible for technology, how we can do things differently by producing creative ideas/things also motivate me. Having relatives that work in IT will help 
              <br>me achieve my career goals and what I want to do within the spectrum.
              <br>Studying at RMIT will hopefully open me and bring me out of my comfort zone. I chose RMIT for a few reasons, good reputation, recognised for leadership and innovative technology, and I live in 
              <br>the countryside, so the online study structure fits my lifestyle. I'm new to most of the IT parts, and when I study at RMIT, I will hopefully learn how to become familiar with programming. 
              <br>My choice for returning to study was because I wanted to have something that was long-term, I was tired of waiting around and being clueless so I wanted to try something that i was interested in.

      <h4>16 Personalities Test</h4>
      <p>I found this test to a bit off sometimes; my test results were that I was introverted primarily. I enjoy being by myself or working with things alone, but I also like communicating with people and working in a team.
        <br> I don't mind listening to other people's ideas and using theirs to come up with my own. However, there may be some negative aspects of being an intuitive person, like missing small detail, getting easily bored, 
        <br>a solid awareness of things going downhill, which can be viewed as pessimistic and second-guessing oneself. I hope when working together as a group, we can all support, encourage and be honest with one another.

    <h4>Learning Style</h4>
    <p>Although my learning style was pretty apparent to me already, I learn best with visuals, demonstration and then doing it myself kind of learner. It's rather difficult for me to look at words and then try to construct them all together.
      <br> I like looking at examples often and a lot of pictures and well-explained videos with images.

    <h4>Creativity Test</h4>
    <p>This test was taken lightly because it doesn't measure how big my creativity can expand. Although it does have some relevance for some self reflection"

    <h1>My Ideal Job<br> Senior Systems Engineer<h1>
      <p>.This position would be very technical with much self-reliant problem solving and collaboration with other teams. The role of a senior systems engineer to craft engaging gaming experiences and assist other engineering responsibilities to create 
<br>multiplayer games mainly, this job would be very demanding. The requirements for this job are to have relevant experience in video game development, conflict resolutions, teamwork skills, problem-solving, coding processes, and implement these in precise API's.
<br>This would be an ideal job for me because it will allow to be able to work with something I enjoy which is games, and seeing how it all comes to together motivates me more. Working in a team environment is fun and it will allow me to make a lot of friends along the way.

<br> In addition, to be able to communicate and support each other in the team. I've had no experience on the technical side of IT. However, I have had experiences in a team environment workplace, which involves preparing food together and being on a farm to make 
<br>sure we all get the suitable fruits into the right boxes, which all include communication, conflict, problem-solving and supporting one another. Since I don't have any experience and everything is new to me, I plan to continue studying for a Bachelor of IT, which 
<br>will build up my communication, problem-solving and IT skills. This allows me to familiarise myself with codes and problem solving for the gaming industry and pick the electives that will enable me to work with games development elements. I am in game development forums, 
<br>online communities such as Facebook groups to better understand and learn things out of school.

      <h1>Project Idea<br>ELift App</h1>
      <span class="square"></span>
      <p> Elift app is an intelligent device app that informs company users about their elevator data and alerts the user if there may be a malfunction. Also, update on 
        <br>policies and overheating details of maintenance and quality and power from the systems building's utility system data check. This app will help you see if you 
        <br>need your lift systems to be cleaned and maintained to prevent accidents and see if everything is in place and completed before using it. Engineer's and maintenance policy checks need to be in place and officially signed by contractors. 
        <br>This app will also include maintenance services, so users don't have to spend a lot of time researching to directly link you to someone in just a couple of clicks. 
      </p>
      <h2>Details of the elevator being completed step by step</h2>  
      <p>There will be a section where the user can click on a button, and a list of short steps will be provided to the user. The user can show this to maintenance services to keep up to date what has been done, on what date as well. 
      <br>This app will prevent numerous accidents from happening; maintaining elevators in places can be a lot of work, but the safety of the people comes first. These accidents happen worldwide wherein in Chile, and a man caught in an elevator. 
       <br>Suddenly the elevator malfunctioned and ascended 30 floors upwards in just 15 seconds with the elevator doors still open before he crashed into the shaft's roof, causing severe leg and head injuries. This elevator wasn't complete and included unintended car movement protection (rope brake) or any Overspeed governer. 
       </p>
      <h3>Policy</h3> 
      <p>Section where a list of Policies set out by each manufacturer in organised folders is easy to view and read. 
       <br>Kwun Tong Industrial Building elevator downfall accident where passengers overloaded causing 29 passengers with injury. In China, EMSD needed to raise more public awareness on the safe use of lifts and the proper way to prevent overloading on elevators. 
       <br>This elevator was then replaced, and EMSD then reduced their elevator car size to comply with their latest requirements. 
      <h4>Improper maintenance</h4>
<p>Like the details of the elevator being built, this organised folder section will include all the maintenance data for each elevator. Also, another file directs you to some maintenance services. 
<br>a Mitsubishi elevator in a restaurant at King's Tower, North point, plummeted down from the first floor due to some wire rope issue and governor fault. As a result, seven passengers were injured in the event.
      </p>
      <h5>Tools</h5>
<p>Tools such as Java, CSS, HTML, Excel, interface (UI) Design, so this app will be organised, clean folders and sections for the application. Simple and easy to navigate pages.
<br>Upon completing the app, I would have created an app designed for users who own places with elevators and ensure safety and maintenance for everyone. I have experienced some scary elevator events overseas and would like to see more protection placed upon these things.
