        <h1>Malis Tang<br>Student<<br>ID:S3915292<br>Email:S3915292</h1>
<p>I was born in Cambodia, Phnom Penh, moved to Australia when I was about five months old to Noble Park, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It's honestly so strange how my parents said they only came here with $50 in their pockets, so they came here to have a better life. 
<br>We lived in a small cramped unit down in Noble Park, and then we moved to Tatura when I was about ten because dad had his job out here. I completed VCE and graduated in 2019, which was not long ago, and I didn't know if I wanted to take a gap year or not. 
<br>So I tried to find what I wanted to do, did some real estate course, don't even know why I did a medical reception course and all these other things that cost me a lot of money
<br>I didn't like any of them, and it bored me quickly, or I'd give up on it. So when I stopped doing my work for the courses, I tried many different jobs like sales, working on a farm, packing tomatoes but now ended up being a sushi roll maker, Barista and now learning how to bake like PIES for my other bakery job? 
<br>I've never done any IT Jobs and new to a lot of IT aspects. While working, I decided to be interested in IT because when I wasn't working or doing any course, I was gaming till 6 am, so I figured why not?
<br>I was involved in many sports, played soccer for the Shepparton Club, did some fitness Bootcamp, played basketball, football, and volleyball competition. 
<br>I'm still currently living at home with my parent's so, unfortunately, can't have a cat or a dog, so I bought three adorable Guinea Pigs named Dabao, Bean and Boo (Boo because he always runs away from me).
